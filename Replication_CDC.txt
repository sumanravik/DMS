Replication:
In SSMS, open the context (right-click) menu for the Replication folder, and then choose Configure Distribution. Follow all default steps and configure this SQL Server instance for distribution. A distribution database is created under databases.
Create a publication for SQL Server ongoing replication as follows:
Log in to SSMS using the SYSADMIN user account.
Expand Replication.
Open the context (right-click) menu for Local Publications.
In the New Publication Wizard, choose Next.
Choose the database where you want to create the publication.
Choose Transactional publication, and then choose Next.
Expand Tables and choose the tables with PK and the tables that you want to publish. Choose Next.
Choose Next, because you don't need to create a filter.
In the Snapshot Agent screen, choose the first option to Create a snapshot immediately and keep the snapshot available to initialize subscriptions. Choose Next.
Choose Security Settings, and then choose Run under the SQL Server Agent service account. Make sure to choose By impersonating the process account for a publisher connection. Choose OK.
Choose Next.
Choose Create the publication.
Provide a name of the publication in the format AR_PUBLICATION_000DBID.
For example, if your DBID is less than 10, name the publication AR_PUBLICATION_0000DBID> (4 zeros). If your DBID is greater than or equal to 10, name the publication AR_PUBLICATION_000DBID (3 zeros). You can also use the DB_ID function in SQL Server. For more information on the DB_ID function, see the SQL Server documentation.
Create a new AWS DMS task with SQL Server as the source endpoint using the user account that you created.




CDC:
For tables without primary keys, set up MS-CDC for the database. To do so, use an account that has the sysadmin role assigned to it, and run the following command.

use [DBname]
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db                
                
Next, set up MS-CDC for each of the source tables. For each table with unique keys but no primary key, run the following query to set up MS-CDC.

exec sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
@source_schema = N'schema_name',
@source_name = N'table_name',
@index_name = N'unique_index_name',
@role_name = NULL,
@supports_net_changes = 1
GO                  
                
For each table with no primary key or no unique keys, run the following query to set up MS-CDC.

exec sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
@source_schema = N'schema_name',
@source_name = N'table_name',
@role_name = NULL
GO
